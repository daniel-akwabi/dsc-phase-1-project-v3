    "- Identify the safest aircraft models based on historical data. The accident rate, fatality rate and incident severity are our key performance indicators in this instance.\n",

    "- Assess the financial risks. As we work to acheive this, I will focus on the maintenance cost and fuel efficiency of each model in order for me to narrow down to the best fit.\n",

    "#### *Purpose of Checking for Missing Values in This Dataset*\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for missing values in this aviation accident dataset serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Data Quality Assessment*: The output shows many columns have significant missing data (e.g., Latitude/Longitude missing ~55,000 values, Aircraft.Category missing ~58,000 values). This helps understand how complete and reliable the dataset is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Analysis Planning*: Knowing where data is missing helps determine:\n",
    "   - Which analyses are feasible (columns with too much missing data may need to be excluded)\n",
    "   - Whether imputation methods are needed\n",
    "   - How to handle cases with partial information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Bias Identification*: Missing data patterns may reveal systemic reporting issues (e.g., certain countries or accident types might be under-reported).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Data Cleaning Decisions*: The missing values in key fields like Event.Id, Accident.Number (~1,500 missing) and Location (~500 missing) suggest these records may need special handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Feature Selection*: For modeling purposes, columns with excessive missing values (like Aircraft.Category with 64% missing) might be poor candidates as features.\n",
